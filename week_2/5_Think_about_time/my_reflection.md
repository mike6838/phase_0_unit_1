# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
My biggest challenge managing time during Phase 0 is my balancing prep work with my job. Coming home physically exhausted makes it difficult to sit down and begin to code.
* How will you combat that? 
I plan on quitting my job.
* What techniques will you try?
In the meantime, I plan on using mindfulness and focusing small so that I can finish bit by bit instead of overwhelming myself with the big picture.
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?
My overall plan is to do the best I can. I'm not sure if I can finish every activitity or read every article/book, but I will do my best. I spent a little more than a year attempting to learn Rails by myself and decided to apply to DBC because I felt that I hit a wall in what I could learn on my own. Much of this prep work is review, but since I'm consuming most of it on my own, I have a familiar feeling of hitting that wall in my ability to learn the material.
