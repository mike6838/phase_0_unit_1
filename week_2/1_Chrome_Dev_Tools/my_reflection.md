# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
	It seems that the DOM is the browser itself. It turns the raw code into viewable webpages. I don't think anything is good or bad about it because it's just a way to consume code visually, essentially. The only downside is backwards compatibility for old browsers, which is not a problem of the DOM, but rather a problem for the consumers and developers. 
* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
	Chrome Web Tools is amazing. I really dislike CSS because of how finiky it is but Chrome Web Tools really helps with manipulating style sheets in real time.
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
	I did not.
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
	I did not.
