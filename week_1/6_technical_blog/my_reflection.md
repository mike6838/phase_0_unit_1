## 8. [Comparing Favorite Websites](8_technical_blog/readme.md) Reflection

Blog url: http://mike6838.github.io/week1_technical.html

Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?

I didn’t feel that I enjoyed it, but I also didn’t dread it. I haven’t got any comments or views. I think creating the blog was helpful for my learning, but the content in the blog post did not help, nor did it hinder. I didn’t feel that it was cumbersome. I feel that I am uncertain about the entire exercise, because I’m still kind of feeling out what’s going on. There’s a lot of work and a lot of reading in Week 1; it’s just a big change.
