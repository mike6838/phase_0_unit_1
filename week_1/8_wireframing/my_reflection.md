## 6. [Wireframing](6_wireframing/readme.md) Reflection

* * What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
* What questions did you ask during this challnge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  
* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  
* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge? 
* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

I learned that web design and the user experience requires users and that seems very easy to forget. Reaching out for users to test the design of your site and report useable feedback is crucial. 

At this moment, I really do not enjoy design, although I do appreciate the user experience. It was not fun working on the plan of my site. I kept thinking that I would like a cookie cutter format, while also thinking how awful that would be as well because of all the potential problems that could arise.
I appreciated the article written by Marcin Treder, “Beyong Wireframing: The Real-Life UX Design Process”, because his realization while working for a design company that the UCD approach didn’t take into account practicing web designers is analogous to web designers designing a website without taking into account actual users and their experiences.  Questions that came up while reading this were: why is so little energy is spent focused on design? Why is it acceptable to deem an approach impractical (for instance, the scientific method has been described as impractical, but if you want to practice science, then you need to use the scientific method)? How do we solve this? I haven’t found any answers, yet. Currently, there is no objective methodology of creating the best user experience, although Treder is trying to establish one. 

I need to put these concepts into practice. 

I did not.

I feel confident in understanding the Learning Competencies for this challenge, although I somewhat disagree on the importance of wireframing.

I enjoyed reading about experiences people had with collaborating with others during the design process. Communication is very important in every part of your life and when reading about individuals fighting for some aspect of design they want during a meeting when there is no established objective standard for anyone to compare to is incredibly interesting. 

Creating the wireframe was tedious. I think from now on, I will consider drawing one.
