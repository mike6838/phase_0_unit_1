## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

In order to create a repository on GitHub, you must first make an account on github.com. Once your account is created, you will have to log in by entering your username and password. After you're logged in, there's an addition sign '+' on the top right of the webpage. You can left click this with your mouse and select "New repository". After the page loads, under the caption "Repository name" there will be a place for you to type in your what you would like to name your repository. You will also have option to add a description and decide whether or not to make your repository public or private; although a private repository requires a subscription fee. GitHub also gives you the option of providing any sort of license as the "README" in order to facilitate sharing your repository. Once you've filled out the requirements, you can go ahead and left click the "Create repository" button.  

Open Source is allowing anyone to view and edit the code of a computer program for their own purposes.
I enjoy the idea of Open Source and it makes me excited and filled with wonder about the future. I also think the role of software piracy plays in curbing the growth of Open Source. After experimenting with Linux, there seems to be an Open Source version of almost everything. I wonder if people were to actually pay the retail prices for software, if that wouldn’t lead to a magnificent boon to the world of Open Source.

I had no idea that copyright was automatic. That is very interesting to me that it requires more work to make something Open Source than to not. Furthermore, licensing is very important because you are explicitly telling users of a computer program (in most cases) the dos and don’ts associated in viewing and using the code. I also didn’t realize the various licenses associated with Open Source which really allows creators to control how open they want their projects to be, for better or worse.

I can’t say any concepts were solidified during the challenge. I really enjoyed using the GitHub application; it makes me feel like I’m using an application for git on my computer, instead of using GitHub on my browser for git (I hope that makes sense.).

I spent sometime on Wikipedia reading about the history of the Open Source movement and the creation of the different licenses.
