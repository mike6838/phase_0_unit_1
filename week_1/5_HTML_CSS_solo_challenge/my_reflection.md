Fortunately, I waited to complete all of my other exercises before I started on my solo challenge, which reduced my overall troubles. I didn’t know how to do a few things, for instance, I wasn’t sure how to write text over a picture. I did a google search and found a great resource (http://css-tricks.com/text-blocks-over-image/)

The concepts I’m still having trouble with is manipulating the placement of divs in CSS.

I learned how to write text over pictures, which was pretty cool when I finally figured it out.

I feel that I am moderately confident with the Learning Competencies for this challenge. 

I’m beginning to develop a love-hate relationship with CSS. I hate how finicky it is, but I kind of love the extent of manipulation you can do with it. Moreover, I found that I both enjoyed the tediousness of CSS.
