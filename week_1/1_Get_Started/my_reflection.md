## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

I originally set up git through Michael Hartl’s Ruby on Rails Tutorial, which was much more difficult to set up. The GitHub Application makes the process much easier and straightforward. I remember my difficulties stemming from not understanding/realizing the difference between git and GitHub. The most important lesson I can take away was that if I’m struggling to understand something, instead of trying again and again to absorb the material from the same source, seek out another source for a different explanation.

Git allows you to save different versions of the same file locally on your own computer, allowing you to view different copies before and after a particular edited version. GitHub is a website that helps users of git share with others or multiple computers files they’ve saved with git. When files are uploaded to GitHub they can be downloaded, viewed, edited, and reuploaded by other users. It would be similar to emailing an attachment to a friend to read and edit and having them send it back to you with the corrections, except with GitHub you could upload it to an entire community with everyone being able to communicate edits while being able to organize different versions and who edited what and at what time.

Version control is the ability to save multiple copies of the same file allowing an individual to go back and see each version that was made. GitHub helps with version control because it allows multiple users to work on the same file/project while ensuring everyone involved knows who is doing what and what time. 

Developers use version control because many things can go wrong during the development process and it is incredibly important and useful to be able to go back to a version that works. This makes sense to me because of how important and practical it is for non-developers. Thinking back to college and high school, I’d love to use git/GitHub instead of attaching and reattaching my text documents to emails. 

Currently, I’m not comfortable with using GitHub. I need more time to work around on it, but I do understand the ideas behind version control and GitHub.
