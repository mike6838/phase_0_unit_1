<!-- Hey guys,

My name is Michael Teevan and I was born and raised in Thousand Oaks, CA. I recently moved to Oxnard, CA last week from Minneapolis, MN where I had been living for the past five years.

My favorite websites are gmail.com and bbc.com.

I'm an abstract random thinker and I'm a multimodal learner with aural (9) and visual (8) being my two strongest areas.

I've got my intro session tomorrow at around noon PST. -->

Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down. 

<!-- This weeks exercise did not ask group members to include their fears regarding DBC; consequently, none of our responses mentioned our fears and I am unable to reflect on that. This weeks experience really helped in giving me confidence in finishing Phase 0 and making it to Phase 1 in SF. This is my second time doing Week 1 for Phase 0 becuase I had to defer because I wasn't able to keep up with my work while balancing other things in my life. This time around, I have my priorities in check and I am able to commit the necessary amount of time needed for Phase 0. -->
