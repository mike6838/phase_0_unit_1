## Release 2: Basic Git Commands
Define the following commands and describe how they work/what they do.   


add
Let's git know that you are adding a file to the repository. It moves the selected file to the staging area. Its increases the scope of your repository. 

branch
The branch command without any arguments after displays the existing branches of your current repository. If you include an argument after 'git branch' it will create a new branch with the name of the argument given.

checkout
"Git checkout <existing branch>" moves the head of the existing branch. 

clone
'git clone <url>' allows you to copy a git repository from a remote location so that you can make changes to the it.

commit
'git commit' records any changes to any files previously staged. Creates a snapshot of files in order to view/modify later.

fetch
'git fetch <url>' takes as an argument the location of a remote repository and downloads the changes locally so that later they can be merged/viewed using 'git merge'.

log
'git log' will display a list or summary of changes made on the current branch.

merge
'git merge' takes any other branch in your repository and merges/combines the differences with your current branch.

pull
'git pull' not only fetches a remote repository, but also automatically merges any changes with current branch.

push
'git push' will "push" the current branch on a local repository and merge those changes onto a remote repository. 

reset
‘git reset <file name>’ allows you to unstage a file without deleting it from your repository. 

rm
‘git rm <file name>’ essentially deletes said file from your directory and removing it from any future commits.

status
‘git status’ will give you a list of files and weather or not they’ve been modified or staged on the current branch.
