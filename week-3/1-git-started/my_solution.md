## Release 2: Basic Git Commands
Define the following commands and describe how they work/what they do.  


#### add
<!-- Let's git know that you are adding a file to the repository. It moves the selected file to the staging area. Its increases the scope of your repository. 
 -->

#### branch
<!-- The branch command without any arguments after displays the existing branches of your current repository. If you include an argument after 'git branch' it will create a new branch with the name of the argument given.
 -->

#### checkout
<!-- "Git checkout <existing branch>" moves the head of the existing branch. 
 -->

#### clone
<!-- 'git clone <url>' allows you to copy a git repository from a remote location so that you can make changes to the it.
 -->

#### commit
<!-- 'git commit' records any changes to any files previously staged. Creates a snapshot of files in order to view/modify later.
 -->

#### fetch
<!-- 'git fetch <url>' takes as an argument the location of a remote repository and downloads the changes locally so that later they can be merged/viewed using 'git merge'.
 -->

#### log
<!-- 'git log' will display a list or summary of changes made on the current branch.
 -->

#### merge
<!-- 'git merge' takes any other branch in your repository and merges/combines the differences with your current branch.
 -->

#### pull
<!-- 'git pull' not only fetches a remote repository, but also automatically merges any changes with current branch.
 -->

#### push
<!-- 'git push' will "push" the current branch on a local repgository and merge those changes onto a remote repository. 
 -->

#### reset
<!-- ‘git reset <file name>’ allows you to unstage a file without deleting it from your repository. 
 -->

#### rm
<!-- ‘git rm <file name>’ essentially deletes said file from your directory and removing it from any future commits.
 -->

#### status
<!-- ‘git status’ will give you a list of files and whether or not they’ve been modified or staged on the current branch.
 -->

## Release 6: Reflection
<!-- I paired during this exercise; both my partner and I showed up having completed the exercise, which we then went over the terms together. I really benefitted from this because there were a few terms that I was having trouble understanding. For instance, I was having difficulties distinguishing between pull, fetch, and commit. Although I can’t say I know each of these terms perfectly and their best practices, I do see the subtle differences.  I’m fairly confident with each of the competencies and now that I begin to use them through the terminal, instead of the GitHub app, I think I will be much more familiar. I enjoyed going over the terms with my partner, because it was great to get another perspective. There were also a few terms not listed that came up, such as staging area and head, which was beneficial to have another person to go over them with.  -->
