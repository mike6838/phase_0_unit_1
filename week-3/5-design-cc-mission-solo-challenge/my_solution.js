// Refactored Code






// Reflection
// Iâ€™ve been struggling to finish my solo challenge since I started it on Thursday. 
// I am mostly confused about how to each of the variables through the computer screen, 
// like in Code Combat. I feel confident in my knowledge in two of the learning competencies. 
// I know how to create variables and object literals and manipulate data within them.
