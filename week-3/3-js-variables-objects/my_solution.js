// I paired [with Rob Kramer] on this challenge.

// Write your code below.

var secretNumber = 7
var password = "just open the door"
var allowedIn = true
var members = ["John", "Mike", "Sally", "Mary"]

// I paired with another on this exercise, which worked out well. I had 
// a lot of trouble understanding the instructions on read.me file and 
// my partner helped me better understand. The exercise was fairly easy, 
// since there was no internal logic used creating functions. We were tasked 
// to define variables and arrays, which we did. Following the directions 
// for the pre written tests went pretty well, also. Iâ€™m use to how RSpec 
// prints test results, going through all the failed tests, and not just 
// stopping after the first one on the list had failed. Although, this might 
// have been an option I overlooked on the consoles of Firebug and DevTools. 
// I feel like I understand the syntax to create variables within JavaScript. 
// The most tedious part of this challenge was understanding the instructions. 
// I really appreciated the JS Intro guide that was linked on GitHub.
