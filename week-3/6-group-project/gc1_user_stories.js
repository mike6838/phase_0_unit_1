// My role in the group is: Person 1

// Here is my part of the challenge:

// Hi,

// I am a high school teacher that needs a program to calculate the grades
// for both of the classes I teach. The only discernable difference between 
// the two classes is that one has an even amount of students, while the 
// other has an odd amount of students. I want to be able to calculate 
// the total of my students’ grades for both classes. I also want the program 
// to calculate the average of the students’ grades for both classes. My last 
// request for you is that I’d like the program to find the median grade for 
// each of my classes. Is that possible? I’d really appreciate it! 
// Thank you so much!

// Sincerely, 

// Your favorite teacher, XOXO
