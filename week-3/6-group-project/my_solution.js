// My role in the group is: Person 1 -  Translate tests into user stories - Michael Teevan

// Here is my part of the challenge:

// Hi,

// I am a high school teacher that needs a program to calculate the grades
// for both of the classes I teach. The only discernable difference between 
// the two classes is that one has an even amount of students, while the 
// other has an odd amount of students. I want to be able to calculate 
// the total of my students’ grades for both classes. I also want the program 
// to calculate the average of the students’ grades for both classes. My last 
// request for you is that I’d like the program to find the median grade for 
// each of my classes. Is that possible? I’d really appreciate it! 
// Thank you so much!

// Sincerely, 

// Your favorite teacher, XOXO


// Reflection:

// My experience working as a group on a project was a lot of fun. Although my group 
// did not pass any of the tests due to my client story, I think we learned a lot about 
// communication. I learned that in the user stories, I need to be more mindful of the 
// variables used in testing and the objects that are used within the test, such as arrays. 
// The problems my group faced was reading my user stories. The rest of the group created a 
// working program using JavaScript based on my story, but unfortunately, it did not pass any of 
// the tests because I failed in leading them. I feel confidence in most of the learning competencies. 
// The part that I enjoyed the most was when it was all-complete was getting everyone together on Google 
// Hangout and talking over what went wrong.
