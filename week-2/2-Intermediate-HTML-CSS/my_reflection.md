# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Add reset.css to your index.html file. What happens?

After adding reset.css to my index.html page, all of the elements on the page shrank in size. 


Industry standards for the web are a great thing because establishing a universal standard for web browsers creates a better web for those who develop and consume. 
The standard HTML structure does make sense to me because it is essentially a straightforward hierarchy of built in headings. 

I do like the new HTML5 elements and the more I use them and the more comfortable I get with them, the more I will like them. They are very clean and they tend to cut down on some of the clutter with ordered and unordered lists.

The reset.css page is necessary because web standards and the browsers that are interpreting those standards are constantly changing. In order for your website to remain the same, in the future and on different browsers, you will need to use a reset.css page to negate all those changes and to use what is in your .css file. 

Within the last five years, I’ve only used Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Opera. The biggest differences I’ve noticed across browsers have to do images. Sometimes images don’t load very well in Firefox. I don’t see that it is either good or bad; as long as I am free to choose what I think is the best, then I am okay with the differences.
