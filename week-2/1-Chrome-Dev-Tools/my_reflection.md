# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

It seems that the DOM is the browser itself. It turns the raw code into viewable webpages. I don't think anything is good or bad about it because it's just a way to consume code visually, essentially. The only downside is backwards compatibility for old browsers, which is not a problem of the DOM, but rather a problem for the consumers and developers. 

Looking at a site using wordpress was interesting. Everything seems to be in a separate div, which makes sense if every separate post used a different div. The biggest difference, with respect to code between my site and a wordpress site is the number of divs used. 

Chrome Web Tools is amazing. I really dislike CSS because of how finicky it is but Chrome Web Tools really helps with manipulating style sheets in real time. I think it was more difficult to work with Code School’s interface than with DevTools. There was many times where I would do what the exercised asked of me and it didn’t pick up until I did it many times over. It would really be great to have a dual monitor set up while using DevTools. 

I did not have any “aha” moments, but I had many, "whoa, this is really cool" moments. It’s unfortunate that I’ve got to use Google’s Chrome browser to take advantage of this incredible resource. 

I spent a fair amount of time on https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/index - I found it useful.
