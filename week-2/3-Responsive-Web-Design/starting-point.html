        Add html tags where necessary. -->
        <p>Responsive web design is making your web site respond to different browsers, devices, and sizes. 
        It can resize depending on the zoom, or if the user resizes their browser, the page should 
        automatically resize to fit the new size. With increasing amounts of large-resolutions screens 
        on the market, web designers must take this into consideration when creating a design that is 
        responsive to this layout.</p>

      <div class="fluid-layouts">
        <!--Include information about fluid layouts you found. 
        Add html tags where necessary.-->
        <p>In a fluid layout, web designers will typically give sections percentage heights/widths 
        instead of exact pixel measurements. This makes the web site more user-friendly and more 
        appealing to the eye, no matter the screen resolution.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="your-conclusion">
        <!--Discuss the purpose of responsive design and fluid layouts and whether
        you think it's good practice to use them.
        Add html tags where necessary.-->
        <p>Overall, I think it is very important to use fluid and responsive design. Today, there 
        are so many devices and screen resolutions that people use to access the internet and we, 
        as web designer, must try to accommodate as many of these people as possible.</p>

      <div class="reflection">
        <!--Add html tags where necessary to make the information make sense. 
        You don't need to keep these questions visible.-->
        <ul>
          <li>How was it to implement these concepts?</li>
            <p></p>
          <li>How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?</li> 
            <p></p>
          <li>How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?</li> 
            <p></p>
          <li>What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?</li>
