# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?
* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?
* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?
* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Implementing these concepts went fairly straightforward. Using percentages instead of pixels for width and height felt natural. The different objects on the page seemed to fall together much easier than when I was using pixels.

Smartphones and tablets have changed web design by offering a multitude of different size screens with their own screen resolutions. Instead of creating a different website for each screen, developers adapted to using responsive web design and media queries in order for their web application to quickly adapt between devices.

There is a wide range of what is considered visually impaired, so instead of developing and designing for each group, I think the best way to handle it is allowing your web app to easily manipulated by other programs or browsers that are designed and developed for the specific purpose of assisting those groups who are visually impaired. 

The concepts outlined within responsive web design mostly make sense. I understand the end goal and what has been implemented to achieve that goal. Currently, media queries are still a bit shaky for me. I understand that they are essentially conditional statements that go into effect once the resolution reaches a certain size, but Iâ€™m sort of hung up about how they are implemented. 

I did not find any additional resources.
