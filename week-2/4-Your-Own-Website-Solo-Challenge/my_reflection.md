# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: mike6838.github.io/index.html

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Out of all that I read that was required and recommended throughout Week 1 and 2, there seemed to be very little theory involved in design and user experience. The articles kept appealing to what the users wanted and what designers and developers argued over. This is not a bad thing, but when starting out, I tend to look for best practices. 

I’m beginning to like and appreciate design and UX more and more. I really did not like reading about it because I got the feeling that some of the authors tried to frame that when most people think of design and UX was they think of it as subjective, instead of relative. 

My process was to think of what I’d personally like my index.html page to look like. I only did a wireframe because it was required. I don’t see much value in using a wireframe when I’m only consulting myself. It’s a great tool to communicate ideas and plans to others, but when creating a webpage by yourself, I find I have much more clarity when I dive into the html and css. 

I'd like to change the color-scheme next.

It was difficult to apply the material, because I was only consulting myself. As I said above, the material involved little to no theory so there wasn’t really any suggestions or principles. It went over how to best listen to users and what not.

I did not find any resources that helped me better understand the topics. I went through a few CSS books I have PDF versions of that I was hoping to get some design theory, but it was only how-to knowledge.
